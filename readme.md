Spiffy Foldtext
===============

THIS PLUGIN HAS NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY RELEASED. CONSIDER IT PRE-ALPHA!

An (arguably) improved foldtext, taking advantage of unicode characters (when it
can) and taking account of actual window display width. Currently written
entirely in VimL despite the great pains doing so causes.
